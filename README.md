# Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Simulation  

This project implements a simulation of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), a fundamental protocol in quantum cryptography for secure communication. The simulation demonstrates the process of generating and exchanging cryptographic keys using quantum mechanics principles, ensuring maximum security against eavesdropping.  

## Features  
- **Key Generation**: Simulates random quantum states (polarization of photons) for secure key creation.  
- **Quantum Measurement**: Applies quantum mechanics principles to encode and measure key bits.  
- **Error Detection**: Implements BB84 protocol to detect and mitigate eavesdropping attempts.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Qiskit**: For creating and simulating quantum circuits.  
- **Python**: Core language for implementing the QKD protocol.  
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data handling.  

## Usage  
Run the simulation to observe the key exchange process between Alice and Bob, along with error checking and shared key generation.  

## Applications  
- Secure communication in quantum networks.  
- Foundational step towards advanced quantum cryptography research.
